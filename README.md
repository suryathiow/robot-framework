## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Makesure Python 3.x is installed (my case, I'm using Phyton 3.9), then run:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.9 -m pip install robotframework                   # Using homebrew to install Robot Framework
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.9 -m pip install robotframework-appiumlibrary     # Using homebrew to install Robot Framework - AppiumLibrary
```

### 2. Start Appium Server

Make sure the Appium server is running before executing any tests.

```bash
appium
```

### 3. Connect Device or Start Emulator

Ensure your Android device is connected:

```bash
adb devices
```

### 4. Run Tests

To execute all test cases:

```bash
robot -d results tests/
```

You can also run a specific test file:

```bash
robot -d results tests/login_tests.robot
```

## Notes

- Ensure Appium and the device/emulator are properly set up before running tests.
- Update locator definitions in `resources/locators.py` as needed for your app.
